## Quic Trace

All the QUIC_TRACE() functions in the code are used to generate traces at run-time. These traces are in arbitrary format. This documents covers different traces and what the values represent.  We are in the process of deprecating these traces in favor of QLog.

The following example is a Quic trace from a real connection in Facebook's production network. We have an internal tool to format Quic traces into such columned file.

```

*reltime* is a timestamp in microseconds. *client_conn_id* and *server_conn_id* are Quic connection IDs assigned by client and server for this connection. A typical Quic trace contains an *event* name and a series of *values*. One special event is *fst_trace*. The value of fst_trace event is an arbitrary string. For all the other events, the values are defined as follow:
